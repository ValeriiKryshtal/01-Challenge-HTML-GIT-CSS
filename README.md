# Code refactor

## Description
This project involved refactoring code for a marketing agency's webpage. The original code was updated to follow accessibility standards in order to better optimize the site for search engines. This required using HTML semantic tags and restructuring the HTML elements in a more logical way, including an alt attribute in all img elements, and making better use of the <title> for search engine optimization (SEO).

In addition, the code was commented more thoroughly and the CSS was reorganized and made more efficient by consolidating some selectors and properties.
