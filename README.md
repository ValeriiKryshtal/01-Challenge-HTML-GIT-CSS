# 01-Challenge-HTML-GIT-CSS

Every day we see a lot of people with different disabilities, so I decided to improve our own website with better web accessibility for people with disabilities. After my improvments 
people with different disabilities will have the access to our website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Also now our website will rank higher in search engines like Google etc. 
In this task I learned how to fix and improve accessibility features.
